        "> One great thing about Kaggle competitions is that they force you to think about validation sets more rigorously (in order to do well). For those who are new to Kaggle, it is a platform that hosts machine learning competitions. Kaggle typically breaks the data into two sets you can download:\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 1. a **training set**, which includes the _independent variables,_ as well as the _dependent variable_ (what you are trying to predict).\n",
        ">\n",
        "> 2. a **test set**, which just has the _independent variables._ You will make predictions for the test set, which you can submit to Kaggle and get back a score of how well you did.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> This is the basic idea needed to get started with machine learning, but to do well, there is a bit more complexity to understand. **You will want to create your own training and validation sets (by splitting the Kaggle ‚Äútraining‚Äù data). You will just use your smaller training set (a subset of Kaggle‚Äôs training data) for building your model, and you can evaluate it on your validation set (also a subset of Kaggle‚Äôs training data) before you submit to Kaggle.**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> The most important reason for this is that Kaggle has split the test data into two sets: for the public and private leaderboards. The score you see on the public leaderboard is just for a subset of your predictions (and you don‚Äôt know which subset!). How your predictions fare on the private leaderboard won‚Äôt be revealed until the end of the competition. The reason this is important is that you could end up overfitting to the public leaderboard and you wouldn‚Äôt realize it until the very end when you did poorly on the private leaderboard. Using a good validation set can prevent this. You can check if your validation set is any good by seeing if your model has similar scores on it to compared with on the Kaggle test set. ...\n",

The training set is used to fit the models; the validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection; the test set is used for assessment of the generalization error of the final chosen model. Ideally, the test set should be kept in a \"vault,\" and be brought out only at the end of the data analysis. Suppose instead that we use the test-set repeatedly, choosing the model with the smallest test-set error.

Therefore, it is important to keep a separate test set, which is only used for the final evaluation. It is good practice to do all exploratory analysis and model selection using the combination of a training and a validation set, and reserve the test set for a final evaluation - this is even true for exploratory visualization. Strictly speaking, evaluating more than one model on the test set and choosing the better of the two will result in an overly optimistic estimate of how accurate the model is.\n",
